				<h1>Paddy Alton</h1>
				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Hello! I'm Paddy, a Data Scientist at <a href="https://apolitical.co">Apolitical</a>.
				Before that, I was a PhD student at Durham University's Centre for Extragalactic Astrophysics; I graduated in 2018.
				This is my website, which I mostly use at the moment for hosting odds-and-ends, side projects etc.
				</p>
				<p>I have a Wix site over <a href="https://paddyalton.wixsite.com/website">here</a>, which is shiny but a bit inflexible.
				It's also a bit out-of-date now.
				</p>
				<h3>What you can find here</h3>
				<p>There isn't really a coherent theme to this site.
				I've used it to host the <a href="/coaching_guide">coaching guide</a> I wrote for my college at Durham (St. Aidans), where I was very
				involved with the rowing team.
				</p>
				<p>I'm very interested in politics and understanding what people think (and why). Some of the things here relate to that instead.
				For example, I made a colour-coded map of the 2016 EU referendum result, broken down by constituency.
				The HTML came straight out of <a href="https://github.com/python-visualization/folium">folium</a>.
				</p>
				<iframe src="referendum_map.html" width="600" height="600" style="border:none" align="middle"></iframe>
				<p>I also made an interactive version using <a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh">Bokeh</a>,
				which is available <a href="interactive_referendum_map.html">here</a>.
				</p>
